            to add a new silly thing to my site (its an easteregg, so you can try to find it!!) so i opened the site
            and realised the formatting was all messed up from the last time was on here, fixing it was
            pretty simple, but then i wanted to make just a couple more small tweaks.. and now im here at almost
            10pm with no homework complete :P</b>
